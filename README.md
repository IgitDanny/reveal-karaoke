# Reveal

While discussing some of the frustrations around presentation
software, eojthebrave and emmajane thought up a fun idea for a
new kind of "Powerpoint Karaoke". What if the slides were
stored in a repository which everyone had write access to?

To make this work, reveal.js will need to be slightly modified
so that the slide show which is being presented must update from 
source every time a slide is changed.

## Format

Every game is different and should (probably) always start from
the same starting point. Fork the repository to start a new
game.

We recommend you play the game with teams, but there is no reason 
this has to be a social game. Teams would try to get their
presenter on stage, and keep them on stage as long as possible.
Other teams would modify the repository (and the rules?) to try
and oust the current presenter. Unless of course the goal was
to stay OFF the stage and you were trying to keep your team
from having to present.

## Software Features

The following is a list of features which we think would make
the game even more fun.

1. Auto advancing the slides.
1. Display commit messages as lib notifications so that
   everyone, including the presenter, can see upcoming changes.
1. As the rules are changed, they are published as a slide.
1. Point scoring which allows a team to cash in their points
   and replace the presenter.
